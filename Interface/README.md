# Interface

## What is an interface

- Interface is a custom type that is used to specify a set of one or more method signatures and the interface is abstract, so you are not allowed to create an instance of the interface.

- An interface type is defined as a set of method signatures. A value of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.

- Interface types express generalizations about the behaviors of other types.

- It facilitate more flexible and adaptable functions because they are not tied to the details of one particular implementation.

- Interface is a type used to specify set of methods.

- Multiple types implement same interface

## Why Interface

- To acheive Polymorphism(Runtime), call is resolved at runtime.

- Reduce duplication of code and reduces size of code

- Reduce dependency between diffrent parts of code

- where argument of dynamic types are needed

- Futureability: Now if we add other object sphere in future, we just need to define area and volume function for sphere without any changes in old code, then pass sphere in slice argument in calculate().
