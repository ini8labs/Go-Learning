# Interface in Go

## What is an interface

- An interface type is defined as a set of method signatures. A value of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.

-Interface types express generalizations about the behaviors of other types.

- Interfaces facilitate more flexible and adaptable functions because they are not tied to the details of one particular implementation.

- Interface is a type used to specify set of methods.

- We can't create an instance(object in python) of interface.

- Multiple types implement same interface
